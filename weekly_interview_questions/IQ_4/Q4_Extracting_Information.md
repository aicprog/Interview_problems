  1. #### Can the list have more than 1 cycle?
       * Consider there to be only 1 cycle for any list.
  2. #### Is the linked list input single or double?
      * The list can be either, feel free to use which ever you are most comfortable with.
  3. #### Should I expect duplicate values in different nodes For example A->B->A->C (Where the second A is a different node than the first A containing the same data though)
       * Yes, in this case your algorithm should return False

  4. #### What should I return if there are no cycles ?
       * Return False if there are no cycles and True if any are present
