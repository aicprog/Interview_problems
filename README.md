## A. Rules for submiting solutions

### Steps
1. Name Your solution according to the File Name Convention listed below (i.e. Q1Medium_bruteforceapproach.py) .
2. Create a folder according to the Folder Name Convention below (i.e. Q1_Algorithms-21 ) .
3. Put all your files, inside the folder you created (i.e. Q1_Algorithms-21 > Q1Medium_bruteforceapproach.py) .
4. Find Your Question Folder (the folder that asks the question you are responding to. (i.e Q1))
4. Put the folder you created inside the Question folder
5. I.E Q1 > Q1_Algorithms-21 > Q1Medium_bruteforceapproach.py is an acceptable folder and file structure if you are responding to Question 1, your solution is named Q1Medium_bruteforceapproach.py, the folder you created is named Q1_Algorithms-21,and your question folder is Q1 .

###  File Naming Convention
<br> | Rules & Descriptions
------------ | -------------
Rule | You must save your solution as Q#ConditionMode_yourchoiceofwords
Q# | is the Interview Question you are answering (i.e Q1 for question 1)
ConditionMode | The difficulty of the contraints of your algorithm operates in. (i.e Easy, Medium). Find this in the text file containing the interview question.
Example |Q3EASY_bruteforce.py indicates the solution is solving Question 3, conditions are EASY, through a bruteforce method and is a python file.

yourgithubusername | Your github username. 
Example |Q3_algorithms-21 is an acceptable folder name if I you are answering Question 3 and your github username is algorithms-21
