  1. #### Does the list have negative values as well?
       * Yes
  2. #### Is the array of integers sorted?
      * No, it is not.
  3. #### Should I expect duplicate integer in the list, such as i.e. [3,4,19,3,3,3,3]
       * Yes
  4. #### What should I return if there are no pairs ? [42,94] Sum: 1
       * Return Null, None, Empty Array (depending on what the language of your choice will allow you)

  5. #### Do I have worry about input validation ? For example, do I need to test the data type of each <br> strings to confirm they are infact strings or should I take that for granted.
    * No. Assume the list is Null/None/, Empty, or contains integers
