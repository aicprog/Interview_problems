# Question:
##### Given two strings, check to see if they are anagrams. An anagram is when the two strings can be written using the exact same letters.

## Recommeded Path 
1. Read the question carefully
2. Ask your interviewer many questions. Do not Make assumptions.
3. Consider the conditions of your problem
4. Do a brute force approach
5. Improve your brute force approach


## Potential Questions to ask your interviewer:

  1. Should I still consider two strings anagrams, if they have the same letters but different cases? For example 'car' & 'Car' or "The eyes" & they SEE".
     * Response:
       Do not consider those string combinations to be anagrams
  2. Should I expect 'white spaces' (" ") only or others such as 'tab spaces' (" \t"), 'new line spaces' (" \n")?
     * Response:
       For now only consider white spaces, but there can be many even consecutively.

  3. Am I dealing with reasonably size strings or extremely large string input?
     * Response:
       The size is reasonable say 100 characters or less for each input.
  4. Although unlikely, are these string inputs sorted?
     * Response
       No, they are not sorted.
  5. Are the the string inputs in specific case (lower case, upper case, or mixed) ?
     * Response:
        <br> I'd like you to consider each scenario.
        <br>1st Scenario: lower case only (i.e. "hello", 'there') are valid
        <br> 2nd Scenario: Mixed case, i.e. "HoW IS it GOIng", "how is it going", "HOW IS IT GOING are all possible" are all valid
        
## Condition Modes
#### Q1_Easy: Consider input to only to be lowercase letters a - z or Null Values.
#### Test Cases:

* your_function("hello", None) returns False
* your_function("public relations", "crap built on lies") returns True
* your_function("clint eastwood", "old west action") returns True
* your_function(" hello "," hello there") returns False
* your_function("start ", " starx") returns False
* your_function("start", "start") returns True
* your_function("jo", " job ") returns False


#### Q1_Medium:consider input to be any character, with mixed cases or null values.
#### Test Cases:
* your_function("public relatiOns$", "$crap built on lies") Returns True
* your_function("clint eastwood", "old west action") returns True
* your_function("start here", "t00 action") returns False
* your_function("clzint eastwood wood", "old west action cxod") returns False
* your_function("public relations", None) returns False
* your_function("start here rrrr", "start here eeee") returns False
* your_function("start here tx", "start here yy") returns False
* your_function("start here", "start here") returns True
